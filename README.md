This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Implementation
App.js is used as the Container through which the Input and List components exchange data through.</br>
I like to keep styles in their respective component folder since it makes sense to me for each component folder to house the entirety of a component's properties.</br>
For now I'm keeping the design simple (and without sass) since this should have been done in an hour but it took me about 2 1/2.

Feel free to give me feedback if you feel there is anything that can be improved structurally or fundamentally!
